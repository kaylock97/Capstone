Data Analytic Project
Adult Health and Nutrition is a topic becoming more and more relevant in America. Anyone who wants to better their health and learn more about what a healthy diet is can benefit from this study. Using Kaggle I downloaded 6 csv files to my local computer and imported all five using pandas in python. Using cdc.gov, I was able to specify which columns to subset and what to name those columns (using the codes in the website). Using pandasql, the subset data frames were joined, and data quality was performed. Using python, duplicated data was dropped, duplicated columns were dropped, participants under 18 and pregnant women were excluded from study, rows with null values in [BMI, calories, and blood pressure] columns were dropped. The questionnaire questions with a float number instead of a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ was replaced with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ string. I also replaced Annual Income, Diabetes diagnosis, and Overweight Diagnosis, gender, and Healthcare Use with a string value in place of the float code number.

I used the years of 2005-2014 My findings from the study were that higher income participants have lower BMIs and eat better quality food. Even though they ate more calories than the lower income levels, they still had lower BMIs. They also ate more protein and fiber, and less sugar than lower income levels. Being diagnosed diabetic improved their diets but they still maintained higher BMI and fasting glucose than non-diabetic participants. Lastly, the more frequent healthcare use, the higher percentage it was a person diagnosed overweight. 

I recommend the CDC conducts a weeklong food diary to get a more accurate representation of what people eat. Next steps include, looking at educational tools, looking at ingredients rather than macros/calories, and lastly looking other factors affect BMI and disease, such as genetics and exercise.
